# React To Do List

* created with React & React Icons
* small consolidation project

## What can we do with it ?

Using a todo list is always useful to write down what you have to get done for the day, so you won't forget anything. 

With this todo list, you can type any chores that you have to get done, as well as modifying it if needed, and deleting it later. 

Its design is quite simple, as todo lists have to be straight to the point, but I still managed to put some colors and design whithin it.
